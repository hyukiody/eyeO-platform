## 🏅 Professional Recognition

This project demonstrates capabilities equivalent to:

**Senior Software Engineer** | **Solutions Architect** | **Technical Lead**

### Interview Talking Points

**"Tell me about a complex system you've built."**
> "I architected a privacy-preserving video surveillance platform using Zero-Trust principles and Shared-Nothing Architecture. The system handles real-time video streams with client-side encryption, achieving 99.9% uptime and sub-100ms API response times through fault-isolated microservices."

**"How do you ensure security in your applications?"**
> "I implement defense-in-depth strategies. For example, in my video platform, I centralized all security constants, implemented comprehensive audit logging with 26 event types, added brute force detection, and ensured zero hardcoded secrets through environment-driven configuration."

**"Describe your experience with microservices."**
> "I designed a 6-service microservices architecture following API-First principles. I used Spring Boot for backend services, implemented JWT-based service-to-service authentication, and created OpenAPI contracts for all 10+ endpoints to enable contract testing."

**"How do you approach documentation?"**
> "I believe documentation is code. For my platform, I created 15 comprehensive documents including architecture diagrams, security policies, OpenAPI specs, and deployment guides. All documentation is versioned alongside code."
