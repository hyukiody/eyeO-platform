# Directive Index

This file tracks the directive sources and how they map into `eyeo-platform` modules.

## Mapping
- `crypto-core/` — secure state IO, encryption framing, key interfaces.
- `edge-node/` — capture/ingest pipelines and offline demo mode.
- `middleware/` — identity, event schema, rate limiting, metrics/logging.
- `frontend/` — user testing UI flows.
- `ops/` — compose stack, scripts, and runbooks.

## Notes
- Keep this index free of secrets and environment details.
- Reference directive documents by repository-relative paths where possible.
